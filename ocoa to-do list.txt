Tips for the Future:
~Use an Img class that can store multiple Texture2Ds and Rectangles
*Use an Animation class
~Add a string.FormatToWidth(SpriteFont font, int width) extension method; adds "\n" wherever string is longer than width
*Don't use the Utilities and GameInfo classes as much, except in Game1 and sometimes UniversalMenu classes; it reduces flexibility
*Add an ImgSerializable class, which stores a Color array with image data, a color r, g, b, and alpha, as well as width and height
**Img.ConvertToSerializable() method
*Make menu items inherit from a MenuInterface class (such as buttons, textboxes, and value sliders)
~Make a Menu class that stores MenuInterfaces and contains the tabbing and enter functions within it
~Use static UniversalMenu class to store all the menus
*Base movement and events off of time and not FPS (reduces lag; increases flexibility)
*Create abstract Interface class, and an abstract InterfaceMenu class (with code for paging and such)
*In interface classes w/ multiple imgs, initialize all imgs on one line (with comma separation ex: int a, b, c;)
*Have an "Achieved On" message on achievement displays to tell when achievement was received
*Make players claim achievements
*Allow users to navigate directly to an achievement via a notification
*With mouse switching to click, add a MouseCursor.ClickRects property, and somehow check if a rectangle is being updated
*Add user to static class
*Static Controls class can also include KeyPress(Keys key) which is bool, stores previous key state and current one; checks if key was up last update but is down now
*Allow for fullscreen button
*Loc not pos
*Have an FPS counter & other "computer health" info displayable by holding key
